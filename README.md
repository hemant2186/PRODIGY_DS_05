Welcome to my submission for **Task 5** of the Data Science Internship at *Prodigy InfoTech*. In this project, I analyzed traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and visualized accident hotspots and key contributing factors.

## Task Overview

The objective was to perform a comprehensive analysis of accident patterns, focusing on:

- Road conditions
- Weather
- Time of day

I examined how these factors influence accident rates and identified hotspots where accidents are most frequent.

## Dataset

For this task, I used the [RTA Dataset.csv](https://github.com/hemant2186/PRODIGY_DS_05/blob/8732e6ddf242ce9f3c2caeffe2cfad7fbfa7b096/RTA%20Dataset.csv), which contains detailed records of road traffic accidents, including:

- **Time \& Day:** Time of accident and day of week
- **Road and Weather Conditions:** Road surface, lighting, weather conditions at the time of the accident
- **Accident Details:** Type of collision, number of vehicles, severity, and location type
- **Casualty Information:** Age, sex, and status of those affected


## Tools and Libraries Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas \& NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib \& Seaborn for data visualization


## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation

- Loaded the RTA dataset and inspected its structure.
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent values in columns relevant to the analysis (e.g., weather, road condition).
- Converted time strings to appropriate datetime formats and extracted hour of the day.


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Univariate Analysis:** Assessed the distribution of accidents by time, day of the week, weather, and road condition.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored the relationship between accident severity and environmental/contextual factors.
- **Hotspot Analysis:** Identified locations, times, and conditions with consistently higher accident frequencies.


### 3. Visualization

- Created bar charts and heatmaps to show accident counts by hour, day, weather, and road condition.
- Plotted severity proportions against time, weather, and surface condition.
- Illustrated accident hotpots using frequency tables and plots.


## Key Findings

- **Road Conditions:** Most accidents occurred on dry, asphalt roads, but wet or damp surfaces showed a higher proportion of severe outcomes.
- **Weather Impact:** While most accidents happened under normal weather, incidents during rain or fog were more likely to result in serious injuries or fatalities.
- **Time of Day:** Accidents peaked during late afternoon and early evening hours, with a secondary morning surge, coinciding with commuting patterns.
- **Day of Week:** Higher frequencies were observed on Fridays and Mondays, potentially linked to increased movement at the start and end of the workweek.
- **Hotspot Locations:** Office and residential areas, particularly at crossings and Y-shaped junctions, appeared as the most accident-prone zones.


## Visual Insights

- **Hourly Trends:** Accident rates climb between 4 PM to 7 PM.
- **Weather and Road Surface:** Rain plus wet or damp roads significantly heighten risks.
- **Severity:** Nights and poor weather amplify accident severity, especially where road lighting is insufficient.


## Conclusion

The analysis of the RTA dataset highlights the critical interplay between environmental conditions and accident risk. Wet weather, nighttime, and specific road types/junctions emerge as key contributors to accident frequency and severity. These insights can inform targeted road safety policies, infrastructure improvements, and public awareness initiatives.
